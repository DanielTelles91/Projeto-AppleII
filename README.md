# Apple II Rev. 0 Replica

This repository documents the complete development of a functional
Apple II Revision 0 replica, following the original schematics,
layout, and design principles.

The project is organized into multiple hardware-specific
sub-repositories. Each one contains schematics, PCB layouts,
documentation, and photos related to a specific module of the system.

The goal is to faithfully reproduce the original Apple II Rev. 0
architecture while documenting the full hardware development process.
